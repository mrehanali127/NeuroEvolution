## Integrate neuron in Evolutionary algorithm 
In this project, we have to classify the given datasets using Evolutionary 
Algorithm (EA). We were using artificial neural networks (ANN) for this purpose. We were given 
a dataset of inputs by our instructor. Our object is to classify the data with 100% accuracy. 
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are very powerful technique to solve the problem like optimization, 
maximization and many more. Evolutionary algorithm is a subset of evolutionary computation. 
An evolutionary algorithm uses a mechanism which is inspired by biological evolution like 
selection, reproduction, mutation, and crossover. Evolutionary algorithms are typically used to 
provide optimal and approximate solutions to problems which canâ€™t be solved easily with simple 
techniques. Optimization problem one of the examples. It may be too computationally intense to 
find an exact solution but sometimes an approximate and optimal solution is sufficient. These 
algorithms work without making any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape.
Artificial neural network (ANN) is the component of artificial intelligence which is meant to 
simulate the working of a human brain. ANN is the piece of computing system design to simulate 
the way the human brain analyzes and processes the information. ANN solves problems that could 
not be solved by the human brain or any other statistical standards. In neural networks each neuron 
takes inputs and after some processing on information, it gives output.
ANNs have capabilities of self-learning that enable them to produce better results as more data 
become available. There are two types of data:
1. Linearly separable data
2. Non-linearly separable data
